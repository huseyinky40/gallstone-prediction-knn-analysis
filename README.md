# A k-NN Based Analysis of Look-Alike Health Profiles to Identify Key Differences in Gallstone Formation

This repository contains the source code and research analysis for predicting gallstone formation using non-invasive clinical data. The project focuses on identifying "look-alike" patient profiles using k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) and ensemble machine learning models to support early diagnosis.

## Project Overview
Gallstone disease is a prevalent gastrointestinal disorder that often remains asymptomatic until complications arise. This study proposes a machine learning-based framework using routinely collected demographic, bioimpedance, and laboratory data to provide a non-invasive screening tool.

### Key Features
- **Dataset:** Analysis of 320 clinical records with 38 features (Ankara VM Medical Park Hospital).
- **Models Evaluated:** k-NN, MLP, SVM, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, AdaBoost, and Logistic Regression.
- **Explainable AI:** Integration of SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to identify key clinical determinants like CRP, Vitamin D, and Visceral Fat.
- **Academic Context:** Developed as an undergraduate research project (Planned for TÜBİTAK 2209-A approval).
