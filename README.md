## Project Overview
This study proposes a machine learning-based, non-invasive decision support framework for predicting gallstone formation using routinely collected demographic, bioimpedance, and laboratory data.

## Key Features
- **Dataset:** 320 individuals with 38 clinical features.
- **Models:** k-NN, MLP, SVM, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, etc.
- **Analysis:** SHAP global feature impact and similarity-based learning.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/huseyinky40/gallstone-prediction-knn-analysis`
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the notebook in the `notebooks/` folder.
